# BreedBot.js

BreedBot is a personal Discord bot project that helps track and manage dinosaur stats for ARK: Survival Evolved and ARK: Survival Ascended. It allows users to log their tames, search by species, and compare stats directly inside a Discord server. Built in Node.js using Discord.js and Sequelize for SQLite storage.
